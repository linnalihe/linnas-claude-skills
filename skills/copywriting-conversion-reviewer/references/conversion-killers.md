# Conversion Killers: Common Mistakes That Destroy Sales

## Critical Mistakes to Flag Immediately

### 🔴 #1: Burying the Value Proposition

**The Problem:**
Making customers hunt for what you actually do.

**Conversion Killer Examples:**

```
Welcome to InnovateTech Solutions!
We're a next-generation platform leveraging cutting-edge AI
to deliver enterprise-grade synergies...
```

↓ Customer leaves in 3 seconds ↓

**Why It Kills Conversion:**
You have 3-5 seconds. If the value isn't immediately obvious, they're gone.

**The Fix:**
Lead with the outcome in 10 words or less.

```
Cut your customer support response time from 4 hours to 4 minutes
```

### 🔴 #2: "We/Our" Instead of "You/Your"

**The Problem:**
Company-focused copy makes customers tune out.

**Conversion Killer Examples:**

❌ "We are proud to announce our revolutionary platform"
❌ "Our company has been serving clients since 2015"
❌ "We believe in innovation and excellence"

**Why It Kills Conversion:**
Customers don't care about you. They care about what's in it for them.

**The Fix:**
Flip every sentence to focus on the customer.

✅ "You'll get instant answers to customer questions"
✅ "You've been wrestling with slow support for too long"
✅ "You'll look like a hero to your boss when response times drop 90%"

**Audit Test:**
Count "you/your" vs "we/our" — If "we/our" wins, rewrite immediately.

### 🔴 #3: Vague Benefits

**The Problem:**
Generic promises that could apply to any product.

**Conversion Killer Examples:**

❌ "Improve your productivity"
❌ "Grow your business faster"
❌ "Better results"
❌ "Streamline your workflow"
❌ "Increase efficiency"

**Why It Kills Conversion:**
Vague = Unbelievable. Specificity = Credibility.

**The Fix:**
Add numbers, timeframes, and concrete outcomes.

✅ "Finish your weekly reports in 20 minutes instead of 3 hours"
✅ "Add 15 qualified leads per week"
✅ "Increase trial-to-paid conversion by 34%"
✅ "Eliminate 6 manual steps from your approval process"
✅ "Reply to customer emails 3x faster"

### 🔴 #4: Multiple Competing CTAs

**The Problem:**
Giving customers too many choices freezes decision-making.

**Conversion Killer Example:**

```
[Learn More] [Download Whitepaper] [Schedule Demo]
[Start Free Trial] [Contact Sales] [View Pricing] [Watch Video]
```

**Why It Kills Conversion:**
Choice paralysis. They click nothing.

**The Fix:**
One primary CTA. Maximum one secondary option.

```
[Start Free Trial — No credit card needed]

```

**Rule:** Every page/email should have ONE clear next step.

---

### 🔴 #5: No Urgency

**The Problem:**
Without a reason to act now, they won't.

**Conversion Killer Examples:**

❌ "Sign up anytime"
❌ "Join today" (same as saying "whenever")
❌ No mention of scarcity or time sensitivity

**Why It Kills Conversion:**
Later = Never. People procrastinate unless pushed.

**The Fix:**
Create legitimate time pressure or scarcity.

✅ "50 spots left at this price—locks in Monday at midnight"
✅ "Limited beta access: Only accepting 100 users this month"
✅ "Your competitors are already using this. Every day you wait, they get ahead."
✅ "This offer expires in 48 hours"

**Important:** Must be REAL urgency. Fake scarcity destroys trust.

---

### 🔴 #6: High Friction CTAs

**The Problem:**
Making it hard to take the first step.

**Conversion Killer Examples:**

❌ "Enter credit card to start free trial"
❌ "Schedule a call with sales" (for a simple product)
❌ Long signup forms asking for unnecessary info
❌ "Request a demo" (when they could just try it)

**Why It Kills Conversion:**
Every extra step loses 20-40% of potential customers.

**The Fix:**
Minimize friction ruthlessly.

✅ "Start free trial — no credit card required"
✅ "Get instant access with your email"
✅ "Try it now — takes 60 seconds"

**Friction Audit:**
- Can they try before they buy?
- Do you need that form field? Really?
- Can they get value before paying?

---

### 🔴 #7: Weak or Passive CTAs

**The Problem:**
Uninspiring action language kills urgency.

**Conversion Killer Examples:**

❌ "Submit"
❌ "Click here"
❌ "Learn more" (the worst—totally passive)
❌ "Enter your email"

**Why It Kills Conversion:**
Doesn't create desire or urgency. No emotional pull.

**The Fix:**
Action-oriented verbs that promise value.

✅ "Get instant access"
✅ "Start growing today"
✅ "Claim your free trial"
✅ "Yes, save me 10 hours per week"
✅ "Show me my personalized plan"

**Bonus:** Add value or outcome to button text:
- "Start my free trial" > "Start free trial"
- "Send me the guide" > "Download"

---

### 🔴 #8: No Social Proof

**The Problem:**
Claims without evidence = distrust.

**Conversion Killer Examples:**

❌ "We're the best solution"
❌ "Thousands of happy customers" (vague)
❌ No testimonials, reviews, or case studies

**Why It Kills Conversion:**
Trust is everything. Especially for new visitors.

**The Fix:**
Specific, credible social proof.

✅ "Rated 4.8/5 stars by 2,847 users"
✅ "Used by companies like Stripe, Notion, and Figma"
✅ "'Cut our reporting time by 70%' — Sarah Chen, Marketing Director at Acme"
✅ "Join 12,493 founders who increased revenue an average of 34%"

**Where to Add:**
- Near the CTA (reduces purchase anxiety)
- In the headline if it's strong
- Throughout the copy as proof points

---

### 🔴 #9: Feature Dumping

**The Problem:**
Listing features without explaining why they matter.

**Conversion Killer Example:**

```
✓ Real-time sync
✓ 256-bit encryption
✓ API access
✓ Customizable dashboards
✓ Advanced reporting
```

↓ Customer: "So what?" ↓

**Why It Kills Conversion:**
Features without context are meaningless. Customers don't know why to care.

**The Fix:**
Every feature needs a benefit translation.

```
✓ Real-time sync → Access your data from anywhere, always up to date
✓ 256-bit encryption → Your customer data is safer than your bank account
✓ API access → Connect your existing tools in 5 minutes
✓ Customizable dashboards → See only the metrics you actually care about
✓ Advanced reporting → Prove ROI to your boss with one-click reports
```

**Formula:** [Feature] → which means you can [specific outcome]

### 🔴 #10: Wrong Audience Focus

**The Problem:**
Writing for everyone = resonating with no one.

**Conversion Killer Example:**

```
"Perfect for businesses of all sizes, from startups to enterprises,
across all industries looking to improve their operations."
```

**Why It Kills Conversion:**
Generic copy doesn't speak to anyone's specific pain.

**The Fix:**
Pick one specific audience and their specific problem.

✅ "Built for SaaS founders who waste 15+ hours per week on manual customer onboarding"

✅ "Finally, a CRM for real estate agents—not sales teams"

**Better to:**
- Convert 50% of the right audience
- Than 5% of everyone

---

### 🔴 #11: Ignoring Objections

**The Problem:**
Not addressing the elephant in the room.

**Common Unspoken Objections:**
- "This seems complicated"
- "What if it doesn't work for me?"
- "What if I need help?"
- "This seems expensive"
- "I don't have time to learn new software"

**Why It Kills Conversion:**
Unanswered doubts become reasons to leave.

**The Fix:**
Proactively address objections.

✅ "Set up in 15 minutes—no technical skills needed"
✅ "30-day money-back guarantee. If it doesn't work, we don't deserve your money."
✅ "Live support responds in under 5 minutes"
✅ "Starts at $29/month—less than your team's daily coffee budget"
✅ "Import your existing data with one click. No manual entry."

---

### 🔴 #12: No Risk Reversal

**The Problem:**
Customers fear making the wrong choice.

**Conversion Killer Examples:**

❌ "Buy now" (all risk on customer)
❌ No guarantee or trial
❌ "All sales final"

**Why It Kills Conversion:**
Fear of wasting money/time prevents purchase.

**The Fix:**
Transfer risk from customer to you.

✅ "30-day money-back guarantee—no questions asked"
✅ "Free 14-day trial. No credit card required."
✅ "Cancel anytime. Keep your data even if you leave."
✅ "If you don't see results in 30 days, we'll refund you and pay you $100 for your time"

**The More Risk You Take, The More They Trust You**

---

### 🔴 #13: Boring, Corporate Language

**The Problem:**
Sounding like every other company.

**Conversion Killer Buzzwords:**

❌ Leverage
❌ Synergy
❌ Innovative
❌ Next-generation
❌ Revolutionary
❌ Best-in-class
❌ Industry-leading
❌ Solutions
❌ Robust
❌ Ecosystem

**Why It Kills Conversion:**
Corporate speak is white noise. Customers tune out.

**The Fix:**
Write like a human talking to another human.

❌ "Leverage our robust platform to optimize workflows"
✅ "Stop wasting time on tasks a computer should do"

❌ "Industry-leading solutions for enterprise stakeholders"
✅ "Tools that actually work—built for teams like yours"

**Test:** Read it out loud. Would a real person say this?

## The Conversion Copy Audit

Run every piece of copy through this filter:

1. ✅ Is the value proposition in the first 10 words?
2. ✅ Does it focus on customer outcomes, not features?
3. ✅ Is it specific with numbers and timeframes?
4. ✅ Does it address emotional pain or desire?
5. ✅ Is there one clear call-to-action?
6. ✅ Is there urgency or scarcity (real, not fake)?
7. ✅ Is friction minimized (easy to take first step)?
8. ✅ Does it include credible social proof?
9. ✅ Does every feature have a benefit translation?
10. ✅ Is it written for a specific audience with a specific problem?
11. ✅ Does it address likely objections?
12. ✅ Does it reverse risk (guarantee, trial, etc.)?
13. ✅ Is it written in plain, human language?

**If you answer "no" to any of these, you're leaving money on the table.**
